                Kits are composed of components that are not marketed separately. They are sold as a kit and intended to be used as a mix or sequentially.

            <p class='govuk-!-margin-bottom-1'>
                Examples of multi-component cosmetic products include:
            </p>
                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                    <li>hair dye sets</li>
                    <li>skin peeling kits</li>
                    <li>permanent styling products</li>
                </ul>
            <p>
                If the cosmetic product is sold as a gift set where the components are not mixed or used sequentially notify each product separately.
