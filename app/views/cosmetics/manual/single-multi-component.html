                Multi-component cosmetics are composed of several components that are not marketed separately. They are sold as a set and intended to be used as a mix or sequentially.
            </p>
            <p>
                Examples of multi-component cosmetics include:
                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                    <li>hair dye sets</li>

                    <li>permanent styling products</li>
                    <li>anti-age/revitalising kits</li>
