            <p>
                If your cosmetic products are on sale in both the EU and UK and you have complete a EU notification, you can use the same data to make registration in the UK simpler.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you do not have access to these files or wonâ€™t be selling the product in the EU, you must register cosmetic products manually.
