                Have the cosmetic products been notified in the European Union?
            </h1>
            <p>
                To make registering a cosmetic product as simple as possible, you can use existing European Union product notification files.

            <p>
                If you do not have access to these files or wonâ€™t be selling the product in the EU, you must register cosmetic products manually.
