            Cosmetic products notified in the EU
        </h4>
        <p>
            The EU Cosmetic Product Notification Portal (CPNP) allows you to export ZIP files containing XML files for each notification.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can upload notification files only as ZIP files containing XML files on the UK cosmetic product notification service.
        </p> 
        <p class='govuk-!-margin-bottom-1'>
           To use the data from your EU notifications for UK notification, you need to:
        </p>
        <ul class='govuk-list govuk-list--bullet'>
            <li>
                <strong>export</strong> your data as ZIP files for all cosmetic products
            </li>
            <li>
                upload your ZIP file containing XML files to the UK notification service
            </li>
            <li>
                if the original EU notification file had an attached document with formulation information, you will also need add this

            Cosmetic products that have not been notified in the EU
        </h4>
        <p>
            You can submit a cosmetic product notification by manually entering information about the product.
        </p>
        <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Cosmetics products containing nanomaterials</h4>
        <p>
            If a cosmetic product contains nanomaterials not already approved for use in cosmetic products, the
            responsible person must notify us of their proposed use 6 months before the cosmetic product
            containing them goes on sale or is given away.
