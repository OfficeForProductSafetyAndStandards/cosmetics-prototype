            Registering cosmetic products in the UK
        </h3>
        <p>
            For safety purposes all <a href='#'>cosmetic products</a> on sale in the UK must be registered. To register a product you need to give details of:
        </p>
        <ul class='govuk-list govuk-list--bullet'>
            <li>the organistation responsible for ensuring regulations are followed, known as the ‘responsible person’</li>
            <li>the cosmetic name, formulation and packaging</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">
            Cosmetic products on sale in the EU before Brexit
        </h3>
        <p>
            Cosmetic product notified to the European Union (EU) before Brexit, can continue to be sold in the UK if information about a new UK-based responsible person and the cosmetic formulation is provided within 90 days of the UK leaving the EU.
        </p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Cosmetics containing nanomaterials</h3>
        <p>
            If a cosmetic contains nanomaterials not already explicitly approved for use in cosmetics, the
            responsible person must notify the UK government of their proposed use 6 months before the cosmetic
            containing them goes on sale.
        </p>
        <p>
            Intended use of nanomaterials that has already been notified to the European Commission does not need to
            be notified to the UK government, as long as a UK responsible person provides evidence of this
            notification within 90 days of the UK leaving the European Union.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cosmetics containing nanomaterials not already explicitly approved for use may go on sale in the UK no
            sooner than 7 months after the date of notification to the European Commission if this occurred before
            the UK left the EU, or 6 months after the date of notification to the UK government.
