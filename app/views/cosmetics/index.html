            Cosmetic products notified in the EU
        </h4>
        <p>
            The EU Cosmetic Product Notification Portal (CPNP) allows you to export ZIP files containing XML files for each notification.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can upload notification files only as ZIP files containing XML files on the UK cosmetic product registration service.
        </p> 
        <p class='govuk-!-margin-bottom-1'>
           To use the data from your EU notifications for UK registration you need to:
        </p>
        <ul class='govuk-list govuk-list--bullet'>
            <li>
                <strong>export</strong> your data as ZIP files for all cosmetic products

            <li>
                upload your ZIP file containing XML files to the UK service
            </li>
            <li>
                if the original EU notification file had an attached document with formulation information, you will also need add this

            Cosmetic products that have not been notified in the EU

            You can register a cosmetic product by manually entering information about the product.

        <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Cosmetics products containing nanomaterials</h4>
        <p>
            If a cosmetic product contains nanomaterials not already approved for use in cosmetics, the
            responsible person must notify us of their proposed use 6 months before the cosmetic product
            containing them goes on sale.
