                A cosmetic product can only be sold in the UK if there is a designated responsible person who ensures it complies with relevant regulation and notifies details of the cosmetic product to the government.
            </p>
            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If you have access to CPNP cosmetic product notification files:</h2>
            <p>
                To make notifying in the UK simpler, you can use notication files from CPNP once youâ€™ve notified the EU. <a href="#">Read how to export your CPNP notification file</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unless you originally notified using a predefined frame formulation, you will also need to provide the formulation files. You can use the same files as used for CPNP.
            </p>
            <p>
                You will need to upload the packaging and label images.
